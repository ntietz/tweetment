Sentiment
---------

The Sentiment library was developed by Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya. I want to license it
under the Apache License 2.0: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
For now, do not assume that that is true. I am waiting to find out the policy
of our university on software licenses.

Copyright 2015 (It is currently unclear to me whether I hold the copyright or the university does, so I am leaving that out for now).

This library is an implementation of work done by Saif M. Mohammad, Svetlana
Kiritchenko, and Xiaodan Zhu. Please see their paper "NRC-Canada: Building the
State-of-the-Art in Sentiment Analysis of Tweets" for more details. It is
