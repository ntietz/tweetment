Overview
========

This library contains a pre-trained sentiment classifier for Twitter data. It
is an implementation of work done by Mohammad et al (information below).
An overview of usage is provided below. An overview of the technical details
can be found in the paper, referenced below.

Note that this is not an example of superb engineering; it is just research
code to serve a purpose, and could definitely be improved in terms of
organization and efficiency, but it does the job for now.

Right now, the library achieves an F1 score of 61.96 on the SemEval-2013 B
dataset. The paper's implementation achieved an F1 score of 69.16. Obviously,
this is better performance. I have omitted two features: parts of speech and
negation. I will add negation in the future. Parts of speech was omitted due to
lack of a Python library for doing this. Again, getting this to work is future
work.

Basic Usage
===========

Requirements
------------

Requires **scikit-learn** version 0.17. Not tested with any others.

You must download the model from the latest release. Download the file
**model.pkl** and place it wherever you'd like.

Usage
-----

To classify tweets, you just need a file with one message per line:

```
<tweet1>
<tweet2>
...
```

Then you simply run classify.sh over this file:

```
./classify.sh model.pkl tweets.txt results.txt
```

The results are printed out into the file specified. The output format is as
follows (but tab separated):

```
<sentiment1> <tweet1>
<sentiment2> <tweet2>
...
```

You will notice that this takes some time. This is mostly the startup time to
load the saved model off the disk. The actual classification of tweets is not
too expensive.

That's it!

Using as a Library
==================

**TODO**: Instructions for this and code samples are coming soon! If you want
to use this and instructions aren't here yet, **please** email me or open an
issue and I will complete this ASAP.

Training It Yourself
====================

First Steps
-----------

**Important: you must do this first, or the library will break.**
You have to do this even if you are not training it yourself.

You must download some lexicons. Most of these are done automatically by running
my script, but there is one you must download yourself. First run the script:

```
cd scripts
./download.sh
```

This will download and prepare the lexicons for you, and will also print some
directions for the other lexicon. If this doesn't work, email me and I'll help.

to use this and instructions aren't here yet, **please** email me or open an

Sentiment
---------

The Sentiment library was developed by Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya. I want to license it
under the GPL but I do not know if I am permitted by the university's policy.
For now, do not assume that that is true. I am waiting to find out the policy
of our university on software licenses.

This library is an implementation of work done by Saif M. Mohammad, Svetlana
Kiritchenko, and Xiaodan Zhu. Please see their paper "NRC-Canada: Building the
State-of-the-Art in Sentiment Analysis of Tweets" for more details. It is
